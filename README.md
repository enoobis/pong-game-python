# Pygame Pong

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Pygame. The game features a scoring system and game over functionality.

## Installation

To run the game, you will need to have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/) and install Pygame using pip:

pip install pygame

Copy code

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command in the terminal:

python pong.py

Copy code

Players can control the paddles using the W and S keys for the left paddle and the Up and Down arrow keys for the right paddle. The game ends when one of the players reaches the maximum score, which is set to 3 by default.

## Customization

The game can be customized by changing the dimensions and initial positions of the game objects, the velocities of the game objects, the maximum score, and the frame rate in the code. Simply open the `pong.py` file in a text editor and modify the relevant variables.
